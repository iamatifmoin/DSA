// The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.

// The operations are described below:

// "../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
// "./" : Remain in the same folder.
// "x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
// You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.

// The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.

// Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.

// Example 1:

// Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.
// Example 2:

// Input: logs = ["d1/","d2/","./","d3/","../","d31/"]
// Output: 3
// Example 3:

// Input: logs = ["d1/","../","../","../"]
// Output: 0

// Constraints:

// 1 <= logs.length <= 103
// 2 <= logs[i].length <= 10
// logs[i] contains lowercase English letters, digits, '.', and '/'.
// logs[i] follows the format described in the statement.
// Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
